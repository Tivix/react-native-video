## Testing
* `yarn install` and `cd ios; pod install`
* Build the apps
  * ios - `yarn build:build`
  * android - `yarn build:android`
* Start ReactJS server: `yarn start`
* Start Appium - by desktop app(recommended) or by `yarn appium`
* Run test - `yarn test:e2e`

Note: For the first run of tests can show some test failing. Give it a second try :(
